# 🔐 API Setup Guide - Brokerage Integration

This guide will help you set up official API credentials for connecting to brokerage accounts like Robinhood and Webull.

## 🚨 Important Note

Currently, **Robinhood and Webull do not offer public APIs** for third-party applications. The framework in this app is designed to work with official APIs once they become available.

## 📋 Current Status

- ✅ **Framework Ready**: Complete OAuth 2.0 integration framework
- ✅ **Security**: Bank-level encryption and token management
- ✅ **UI/UX**: Plaid-style connection flow
- ❌ **Live APIs**: Waiting for official API access from brokerages

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions (When APIs Become Available)

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Robinhood API Credentials (when available)
ROBINHOOD_CLIENT_ID=your_robinhood_client_id
ROBINHOOD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_robinhood_client_secret

# Webull API Credentials (when available)
WEBULL_CLIENT_ID=your_webull_client_id
WEBULL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_webull_client_secret
```

### 2. Deep Link Configuration

Add the following to your `app.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default {
  // ... existing config
  scheme: "gpt5",
  // ... rest of config
};
```

### 3. Register Your App

When APIs become available, you'll need to:

1. **Robinhood**: Register at their developer portal
2. **Webull**: Apply for API access through their developer program
3. **Set Redirect URIs**: Use `gpt5://auth/robinhood` and `gpt5://auth/webull`

## 🔄 How Apps Like Rocket Money Actually Connect

### 🏦 **Financial Data Aggregation Services**

Apps like Rocket Money, Mint, and Personal Capital use third-party services:

1. **Plaid** - Most popular (used by Venmo, Cash App, etc.)
2. **Yodlee** - Enterprise-grade (powers Mint, Personal Capital)
3. **MX** - Growing alternative
4. **Finicity** - Mastercard-owned

### 🛠️ **The Real Process:**

```
Your App → Plaid API → Screen Scraping + AI → Robinhood/Webull → Structured Data
```

1. **User logs in** through Plaid's secure interface
2. **Plaid stores credentials** securely
3. **Automated bots** log in and scrape data regularly
4. **AI parses** the scraped data into structured format
5. **Your app receives** clean, standardized data via API

### 💰 **Cost & Implementation:**

- **Plaid**: ~$0.60 per connected account per month
- **Yodlee**: Enterprise pricing (typically $10K+ setup)
- **Setup Time**: 1-2 weeks for integration

## 🚀 **Recommended Implementation Options**

### Option 1: **Plaid Integration** (Recommended) 💰

**Setup Steps:**

```bash
# Install Plaid SDK
npm install react-native-plaid-link-sdk

# Add environment variables
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_plaid_client_id
PLAID_SECRET=your_plaid_secret
PLAID_ENV=sandbox  # or production
```

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Use the PlaidLinkModal component (already created)
import PlaidLinkModal from "../components/common/PlaidLinkModal";

// Handle successful connection
const handlePlaidSuccess = async (publicToken: string, metadata: any) => {
  const accessToken = await plaidIntegrationService.exchangePublicToken(
    publicToken
  );
  const holdings = await plaidIntegrationService.getHoldings(accessToken);
  // Now you have real portfolio data!
};
```

**Pros:**

- ✅ Works with Robinhood, Webull, and 12,000+ institutions
- ✅ Official, secure, bank-grade connection
- ✅ Real-time data updates
- ✅ No maintenance required

**Cons:**

- 💰 ~$0.60 per connected account per month
- 📋 Requires business verification

### Option 2: **Current WebView Method** (Free) 🆓

**What we have now:**

- WebView-based login to Robinhood/Webull
- Session token extraction
- Direct API calls using extracted tokens

**Pros:**

- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ Already implemented
- ✅ Works today

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ More fragile (websites change)
- ⚠️ Requires maintenance
- ⚠️ May break with security updates

### Option 3: **Manual/CSV Import** (Fallback) 📊

**Implementation:**

- File picker for CSV imports
- Manual position entry forms
- Periodic manual updates

**Pros:**

- ✅ Always works
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ User has full control

**Cons:**

- ⏰ Manual effort required
- 📅 Not real-time
- 🔄 No automatic updates

## 🧪 Testing the Framework

Even without live APIs, you can test the integration framework:

1. Set dummy credentials in your `.env` file
2. The app will show "API Credentials Required" status
3. The connection flow will work up to the actual API calls

## 📞 Need Help?

If you have questions about the integration framework or need assistance setting up the credentials when APIs become available, please refer to the code documentation in:

- `src/services/brokerageApiIntegration.ts`
- `src/components/common/PlaidStyleLinkModal.tsx`
- `src/screens/BrokerageAccountsScreen.tsx`

## 🔮 Future Updates

This framework is designed to be easily updated when official APIs become available. The integration points are clearly defined and ready for live implementation.
