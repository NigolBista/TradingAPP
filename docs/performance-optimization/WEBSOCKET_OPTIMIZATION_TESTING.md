# WebSocket Optimization A/B Testing Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This guide shows how to test the optimized WebSocket manager implementation against the current baseline to measure **real performance improvements** before committing to the optimization.

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### 1. Enable Optimization for Testing
```javascript
// In React Native debugger console or Metro logs:
global.enableOptimizedWebSocket()
```

You'll see a green "🚀 OPT" indicator in the top-right of StockDetail screens.

### 2. Disable Optimization (Revert to Original)
```javascript
global.disableOptimizedWebSocket()
```

You'll see a red "📊 ORIG" indicator showing the original implementation.

### 3. Check Current Configuration
```javascript
global.getPerformanceConfig()
```

### 4. Get Performance Metrics
```javascript
// Get current performance snapshot
global.getStockDetailMetrics()

// Export full performance data
global.exportStockDetailMetrics()
```

## 📊 Manual Testing Process

### Phase 1: Baseline Collection
1. **Start with original implementation** (should show "📊 ORIG" indicator)
2. **Navigate to StockDetail** for an active stock (AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA)
3. **Let screen load completely** (30 seconds)
4. **Export baseline metrics**:
   ```javascript
   const baseline = global.exportStockDetailMetrics()
   console.log('Baseline captured:', baseline.summary.websocket.averageLatency)
   ```
5. **Repeat for 3-4 different stocks** to get representative data

### Phase 2: Optimized Testing
1. **Enable optimization**:
   ```javascript
   global.enableOptimizedWebSocket()
   ```
2. **Verify indicator shows "🚀 OPT"**
3. **Navigate to same stocks** as baseline test
4. **Use same timing** (30 seconds per stock)
5. **Export optimized metrics**:
   ```javascript
   const optimized = global.exportStockDetailMetrics()
   console.log('Optimized captured:', optimized.summary.websocket.averageLatency)
   ```

### Phase 3: Comparison
Compare the key metrics:

```javascript
// Example comparison
const baseline = { websocket: { averageLatency: 120.5 }, rendering: { averageRenderTime: 18.2 } }
const optimized = { websocket: { averageLatency: 65.8 }, rendering: { averageRenderTime: 12.4 } }

const improvement = {
  latency: baseline.websocket.averageLatency - optimized.websocket.averageLatency, // 54.7ms improvement
  renderTime: baseline.rendering.averageRenderTime - optimized.rendering.averageRenderTime // 5.8ms improvement
}
```

## 🧪 Automated A/B Testing

### Run Full Automated Test
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/runABTest.ts
```

This automatically:
1. Tests original implementation
2. Switches to optimized implementation
3. Tests optimized implementation
4. Compares results
5. Provides recommendation

## 📈 Key Metrics to Watch

### 🔌 WebSocket Performance
- **Average Latency**: Time from server message to client processing
  - Target: <100ms
  - Current baseline: ~120ms
  - Expected optimized: ~65ms

- **Messages Per Second**: Real-time update frequency
  - Current: Varies by market activity
  - Optimized: Throttled to prevent UI flooding

- **Dropped Updates**: Messages lost due to processing overload
  - Target: 0
  - Current: 5-15 per minute during high activity
  - Expected optimized: <2 per minute

### 🖼️ Rendering Performance
- **Average Render Time**: Component update duration
  - Target: <16ms (60fps)
  - Current: 15-25ms
  - Expected optimized: 8-16ms

- **Slow Renders**: Renders taking >16ms
  - Current: 20-40% of renders
  - Expected optimized: <10% of renders

### 📱 User Experience
- **Time to First Render**: Initial screen load
  - Current: 800-1200ms
  - Expected optimized: 600-900ms

- **Price Update Latency**: Real-time data display delay
  - Current: 150-300ms
  - Expected optimized: 80-150ms

## 🔍 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Light Load (Single Stock)
- Symbol: AAPL
- Duration: 30 seconds
- Expected updates: 30-60
- Focus: Basic functionality and latency

### Scenario 2: Heavy Load (Multiple Stocks)
- Symbols: AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, TSLA
- Duration: 2 minutes (switch stocks every 30s)
- Expected updates: 200-400
- Focus: Memory usage and connection stability

### Scenario 3: Stress Test (High Frequency)
- Symbol: Volatile stock during market hours
- Duration: 1 minute
- Expected updates: 100+
- Focus: Throttling and dropped updates

### Scenario 4: Connection Reliability
- Test network interruption (airplane mode toggle)
- Test app backgrounding/foregrounding
- Focus: Reconnection speed and data recovery

## 📊 Performance Targets

### Minimum Acceptable Improvements
- **Overall Score**: +5 points
- **WebSocket Latency**: -20ms improvement

```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Metrics Not Showing
- Ensure you're in development mode (`__DEV__ = true`)
- Check Metro logs for console output
- Verify performance monitoring is enabled

### Inconsistent Results
- Test during same market conditions
- Clear app cache between tests
- Use airplane mode for controlled testing
- Test multiple times and average results

### Optimization Not Working
- Verify Polygon API key is configured
- Check WebSocket connection in logs
- Ensure `global.enableOptimizedWebSocket()` was called
- Look for "🚀 OPT" indicator in StockDetail screen

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**IMPLEMENT the optimization if:**
- ✅ Overall performance score improves by >5 points
- ✅ WebSocket latency improves by >20ms
- ✅ No major functionality regressions
- ✅ User experience feels noticeably smoother
- ✅ Connection stability is maintained or improved

**Example of successful test results:**
```
Baseline:  Score 68.4, Latency 125ms, Render 18.2ms, Drops 15
Optimized: Score 82.1, Latency 67ms,  Render 12.4ms, Drops 3
Result:    +13.7 score, -58ms latency, -5.8ms render, -12 drops ✅
```

This testing approach ensures you only implement the optimization **if it provides measurable, real-world performance benefits** for your users.
