### 📊 Implementation Architecture

#### Key Components Created

**Performance Monitoring (`src/utils/`)**
- `performanceMonitor.ts` - Core metrics collection system
- `performanceTest.ts` - Automated test harness with scenarios
- `performanceInstrumentation.ts` - React hooks for component monitoring

**Optimized WebSocket (`src/services/`)**
- `optimizedWebSocketManager.ts` - Throttled, pooled WebSocket manager
- `useOptimizedStockDetails.ts` - Drop-in replacement hook

**Testing Infrastructure (`scripts/`)**
- `runBaselineTest.ts` - Automated baseline measurement
- `comparePerformance.ts` - Before/after comparison analysis
- `runABTest.ts` - Complete A/B testing automation

**Configuration (`src/config/`)**
- `performanceConfig.ts` - Feature flags and settings

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Collect Baseline Metrics
```bash
# Run automated baseline test
npx ts-node scripts/runBaselineTest.ts

# Or manually via debug console
global.exportStockDetailMetrics()
```

### 2. Toggle Optimization
```javascript
// Enable optimized WebSocket (green "🚀 OPT" indicator)
global.enableOptimizedWebSocket()

// Revert to original (red "📊 ORIG" indicator)
global.disableOptimizedWebSocket()
```

### 3. Run A/B Comparison
```bash
# Automated A/B test with recommendation
npx ts-node scripts/runABTest.ts
```

## 📈 Expected Performance Gains

**Target Improvements:**
- **50-80ms reduction** in WebSocket latency
- **30-50% fewer** dropped updates during high activity
- **2-6ms improvement** in render times
- **10-20 point increase** in overall performance score

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ >5 point overall score improvement
- ✅ >20ms latency reduction
- ✅ No major functionality regressions
- ✅ Stable connection reliability

## 🔧 Key Features

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time WebSocket latency tracking
- Component render time measurement
- Dropped update counting
- Memory usage monitoring
- User experience metrics (time to first render, etc.)

### A/B Testing System
- Feature flag-based implementation switching
- Visual indicators showing active implementation
- Automated test scenarios (light load, heavy load, stress test)
- Statistical comparison with clear recommendations

### Optimized WebSocket Manager
- Connection pooling with automatic reconnection
- Intelligent throttling (configurable Hz)
- Rate limiting to prevent UI flooding
- Buffer management for smooth delivery
- Compatible with existing Polygon WebSocket API

## 📊 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Light Load
- **Purpose**: Basic functionality validation
- **Setup**: Single stock (AAPL), 30 seconds
- **Focus**: Latency and basic performance

### Scenario 2: Heavy Load
- **Purpose**: Multi-stock stress testing
- **Setup**: 4 stocks, 2 minutes, rapid switching
- **Focus**: Memory usage and connection stability

### Scenario 3: Stress Test
- **Purpose**: High-frequency update handling
- **Setup**: Volatile stock, 1 minute, market hours
- **Focus**: Throttling effectiveness and dropped updates

### Scenario 4: Connection Reliability
- **Purpose**: Network interruption recovery
- **Setup**: Airplane mode toggle, app backgrounding
- **Focus**: Reconnection speed and data recovery

## 🎯 Implementation Decision Framework

### ✅ IMPLEMENT if:
- Overall performance score improves by >5 points
- WebSocket latency improves by >20ms
- No major functionality regressions
- User experience feels noticeably smoother
- Connection stability maintained or improved

### ❌ DON'T IMPLEMENT if:
- Overall score decreases by >2 points
- WebSocket latency increases by >10ms
- Render time increases by >3ms
- More than 3 major regressions detected
- Memory usage increases significantly

### 🔍 NEEDS MORE TESTING if:
- Mixed results across test scenarios
- Marginal improvements (<5 points)
- Network-dependent performance variations
- User feedback conflicts with metrics

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Metrics Not Showing**
- Ensure development mode (`__DEV__ = true`)
- Check Metro logs for console output
- Verify performance monitoring enabled

**Inconsistent Results**
- Test during same market conditions
- Clear app cache between tests
- Use airplane mode for controlled testing

**Optimization Not Working**
- Verify Polygon API key configured
- Check WebSocket connection logs
- Look for implementation indicator ("🚀 OPT" vs "📊 ORIG")
