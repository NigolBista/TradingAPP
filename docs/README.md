- **[Baseline Measurement](./performance-optimization/BASELINE_PERFORMANCE_MEASUREMENT.md)** - How to collect current metrics
- **[A/B Testing Guide](./performance-optimization/WEBSOCKET_OPTIMIZATION_TESTING.md)** - Complete testing procedures
- **[Implementation Checklist](./performance-optimization/IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md)** - Step-by-step verification
- **[Architecture Overview](./performance-optimization/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)** - Technical deep-dive
- **[StockDetail Performance Plan](./performance-optimization/STOCKDETAIL_PERFORMANCE_PLAN.md)** - Detailed optimization roadmap

**Status**: ✅ **Ready for Testing** - Can start A/B testing immediately

### 🏗️ **Architecture** [`/architecture/`](./architecture/)
**Purpose**: System architecture and infrastructure documentation

- **[Cache Manager Usage](./architecture/CACHE_MANAGER_USAGE.md)** - Performance utilities lifecycle management

**Status**: 📖 **Reference Documentation** - Implementation guidance

### 🔄 **Migration** [`/migration/`](./migration/)
**Purpose**: Platform migration analysis and recommendations

- **[Expo vs Native Analysis](./migration/EXPO_VS_NATIVE_ANALYSIS.md)** - Critical platform evaluation

**Status**: ⚠️ **Critical Decision Required** - Strategic platform choice

## 🎯 **Immediate Action Items**

### **High Priority (This Week)**

#### 1. **Performance Testing** 🚀
```bash
# Start A/B testing the WebSocket optimization
cd docs/performance-optimization
# Follow the README.md quick start guide
```

**Why**: Optimization is ready but needs validation before production deployment.

#### 2. **Platform Decision** ⚠️
```bash
# Review the migration analysis
cd docs/migration
cat EXPO_VS_NATIVE_ANALYSIS.md
```

**Why**: Performance limitations indicate Expo may not be suitable for production trading app.

### **Medium Priority (Next 2 Weeks)**

#### 3. **Architecture Implementation** 🏗️
```bash
# Implement proper lifecycle management
cd docs/architecture
cat CACHE_MANAGER_USAGE.md
```

**Why**: Prevents memory leaks and ensures production stability.

## 📊 **Document Types & Usage**

### **Implementation Guides** 🔧
