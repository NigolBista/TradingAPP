1. scalable notification, user should be able to add alert per ticker and our system should be able to handle lots of alerts for hundrends of ticker. should be in queue, priority based and also should be queued when device is offline and notified once the user comes online. in the app we need alerts page that lits all the alerts.

2. we need we crawel agent, mostly the discord server for differnt groups where the people can talk about entry and exit and we should get this data, aggregate data from different discord servers and our analysis engine should keep in mind the entry and exit of each group and if they are talking about same stock we need to keep in mind what lever they are talking and if this groups price can be sequence for bigger move because one group can push price to one level, then when it reaches, other group can push that higher like this in sequence

3. comprehensive focus scree, this needs to aggregate market news, and stocks that are in focus and get news about them in condensed form, get earnings, fed news etc. this can also have a section that we can populate based on the data crawled form discord on what people are talking in the discord channel.
