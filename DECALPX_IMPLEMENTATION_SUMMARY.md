# DecalpX Implementation Summary

## ðŸš€ Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive DecalpX trading analysis system with both a mini dashboard widget and a full-featured screen, while fixing the maximum call stack depth issue in the market overview store.

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Maximum Call Stack Depth Error**

- **Problem**: Circular dependency in `useMarketOverviewStore.getSentimentSummary()` calling `get().getNewsSentimentCounts()` which was causing infinite recursion
- **Solution**: Refactored `getSentimentSummary()` to directly access the state and inline the sentiment counting logic to avoid circular calls

```typescript
// Before (causing circular dependency)
const counts = get().getNewsSentimentCounts();

// After (direct state access)
const state = get();
const news = state.rawNews || [];
// ... inline sentiment counting logic
```
