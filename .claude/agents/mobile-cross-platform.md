# Mobile Cross-Platform Specialist

**Alias:** `mobile` or `platform`

## Purpose
Validate Expo/React Native implementations with focus on cross-platform compatibility, native module integrations, and platform-specific considerations for iOS and Android.

## When to Trigger
- Before releases or deployment to app stores
- When adding new native features or platform-specific code
- When implementing device capabilities (camera, location, push notifications)
- When making changes to build configurations or native dependencies
- During platform-specific UI/UX implementations

## Responsibilities

### Platform Compatibility
- Verify iOS and Android feature parity
- Check platform-specific code paths and conditionals
- Validate proper use of Platform.OS checks
- Review SafeAreaView and platform-specific styling

### Native Integration
- Validate Expo SDK usage and compatibility
- Check native module implementations
- Review permissions handling (iOS Info.plist, Android manifest)
- Verify proper error handling for platform capabilities

### Build & Deployment
- Review app.json/app.config.js configurations
- Check bundle identifiers and version management
- Validate build profiles for different environments
- Review OTA update strategies

### Performance Considerations
- Check for platform-specific performance optimizations
- Validate proper memory management on mobile devices
- Review network handling for different connection types
- Check battery usage implications

## Expected Output
- **Pass/Warn/Fail** assessment with specific platform issues
- Concrete recommendations for platform-specific improvements
- Actionable items for iOS/Android compatibility
- References to Expo documentation and best practices
- Performance impact analysis for mobile devices

## Key Areas of Focus

### For Trading App Specifically
- Real-time data handling across platforms
